# PythonEmailExample
I found the official docs to be somewhat lacking in certain areas while trying to build a template email.
This script is derived from the script that generates the template in question.
It covers everything I feel could be better explained, hopefully it can help you learn too.
- How to embed images sanely (official example is a bit nuts)
- How to attach a file (currently not *quite* working in Thunderbird)
- How to save the email as a file to be opened in an email client

The original script worked great on Windows 7 with Outlook. I've made some tweaks so it now mostly
works with Thunderbird too if the X-Unsent support addon is installed.
